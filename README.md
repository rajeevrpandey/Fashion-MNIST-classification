## Fashion MNIST Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

## Description: 
Developed a deep learning model to classify images into 10 categories from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Technologies: 
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras Tuner, TensorBoard

## Key Contributions:
Loaded and preprocessed the dataset, including normalization and data splitting.
Designed a Sequential model with input, flatten, and dense layers using ReLU and softmax activations.
Compiled the model with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent optimizer.
Implemented training with model checkpointing and early stopping callbacks.
Conducted hyperparameter optimization using Keras Tuner.
Visualized training metrics using Matplotlib and TensorBoard.

## Results: 
Achieved an accuracy of 84.22% on the test set.
